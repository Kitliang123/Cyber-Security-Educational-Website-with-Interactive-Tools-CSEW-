<p>
    Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) was originally developed by Praetox Technologies as an open-source network stress testing tool. It allowed developers to subject their servers to heavy network traffic loads for diagnostic purposes, but it has since been modified in the public domain through various updates and been widely used by Anonymous as a DDoS tool. Other than that, Low Orbit Ion Cannon (LOIC) is network stress testing tool, meaning it is designed to test how much traffic a target can handle for planning future resource expectations. The software has inspired other similar software such as JavaScript, LOIC, which allows a user to do stress testing directly from a web browser. The software was famously used by Anonymous to help them facilitate DDoS attacks against several websites, including some very well-known public entities. Some legal arguments have been made that LOIC is similar to going to a website several thousand times; however, some American law enforcement groups treat the use of LOIC as a violation of the computer security and fraud act.
